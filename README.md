I was tasked to complete an inventory project to obtain PC information such as serial numbers, bios asset tag, IP address , PC names, models, and operating systems that had to be completed within 2 weeks from various health care clinics
The main idea was to mitigate traveling to obtain the requested information.
This was my first attempt creating any script or code so I managed to put together a script in powershell and compile it to an EXE file within two days. 
As long as the PC was on the network I was able to retrieve the requested information on the network.
